Welcome to my homepage. In this post I'll try to explain why and how this site was build.

I created this website to give an overview about my person and the projects I'm working on.

## Setup

This website is generated by the static website generator [Hugo][1] using the awesome [After Dark theme][2]. I track the source files of the website in a [GitHub repository][3]. The web server is a [nginx server][5] running on my own dedicated server from [Kimsufi][6] and does not log the visitors IP address (I **do** write access logs but I will never log IP addresses).

I chose a static site generator over a CMS like WordPress because plain markdown files are easier to manage e.g. using git in contrast to WordPress posts being stored somewhere deep in a database. Also have a look at the amount of security releases in the [WordPress release notes][7]. Hugo generates static HTML files which are served through nginx, so there are no security risks.

The web server forces you to use a TLS encrypted connection using HTTP/2, therefore I used [Let's Encrypt][8] to get a free certificate (you might want to check out my awesome [SSL rating][9]).

All posts are written using [Vim][4] with some plugins. My Vim configuration can be seen in my [dotfile repository][10].
