## About Me

I'm Valentin, a computer science student from Regensburg, Germany. Currently I'm
studying at [OTH Regensburg][1].

My interests are mainly in IT security and open source software but also
practical cryptography and blockchain based technologies. I also like
administrating Linux machines and planing network infrastructures.  In my free
time I like to play around with binary analysis and exploiting techniques by
solving wargames.

I'm coding since ~2010.

Currently working at [EBSnet][2].
