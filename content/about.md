## About Me

I'm Valentin, a computer science student from Regensburg, Germany.  I received
my bachelor's degree after graduating from [OTH Regensburg][OTHR] in 2018, started
my masters degree at [Ruhr Universit√§t Bochum][RUB] and am now back again at OTH
Regensburg to finsih my masters degree.

My interests are mainly in IT security and open source software but also
practical cryptography and blockchain based technologies.  I also like
administrating Linux machines and planing network infrastructures.  In my free
time I like to play around with binary analysis and exploiting techniques by
solving CTFs and wargames.

I'm coding since ~2010.

Currently working at [EBSnet][2].
