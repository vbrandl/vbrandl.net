## About Me

I'm Valentin, a computer science student from Regensburg, Germany. Currently I'm studying at [OTH Regensburg][1].

My interests are mainly in IT security and open source software but also practical cryptography and blockchain based technologies. I also like administrating Linux machines and planing network infrastructures.
In my free time I like to play around with binary analysis and exploiting techniques by solving wargames.

Currently working at [EBSnet][2].
