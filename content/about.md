## About Me
I'm Valentin, an computer science student from Regensburg, Germany. Currently I'm studying at [OTH Regensburg](https://www.oth-regensburg.de/).

My interests are mainly in IT security and open source software but also practical cryptography and blockchain based technologies. I also like administrating Linux machines and planing network infrastructures.
In my free time I like to play around with binary analysis and exploiting techniques by solving wargames.

I'm coding since ~2010.

Currently working at [EBSnet](http://ebsnet.de/).
